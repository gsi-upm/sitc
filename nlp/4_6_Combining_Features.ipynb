    "Some authors obtain the different featuras as lists and then join these lists, a good example is shown [here](http://www.aicbt.com/authorship-attribution/) for authorship attribution. Other authors use *FeatureUnion* to join the different sparse matrices, as shown [here](http://es.slideshare.net/PyData/authorship-attribution-forensic-linguistics-with-python-scikit-learn-pandas-kostas-perifanos) and [here](http://zacstewart.com/2014/08/05/pipelines-of-featureunions-of-pipelines.html).

The sentiment of reviews is binary, meaning the IMDB rating < 5 results in a sentiment score of 0, and rating >=7 have a sentiment score of 1. No individual movie has more than 30 reviews. The 25,000 review labeled training set does not include any of the same movies as the 25,000 review test set. In addition, there are another 50,000 IMDB reviews provided without any rating labels.For this competition, there are eight essay sets. Each of the sets of essays was generated from a single prompt. Selected essays range from an average length of 150 to 550 words per response. Some of the essays are dependent upon source information and others are not. All responses were written by students ranging in grade levels from Grade 7 to Grade 10. All essays were hand graded and were double-scored. Each of the eight data sets has its own unique characteristics. The variability is intended to test the limits of your scoring engine's capabilities.\n",
