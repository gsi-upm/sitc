    "Machine learning algorithms are programs that learn a model from a dataset with the aim of making predictions or learning structures to organize the data.\n",

    "In scikit-learn, machine learning algorithms take as an input a *numpy* array (n_samples, n_features), where\n",
    "* **n_samples**: number of samples. Each sample  is an item to process (i.e. classify). A sample can be a document, a picture, a sound, a video, a row in database or CSV file, or whatever you can describe with a fixed set of quantitative traits.\n",
    "* **n_features**: The number of features or distinct traits that can be used to describe each item in a quantitative manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of features should be defined in advanced and it can be very high dimensional (e.g. millions of features) with most of them being zeros for a given sample. In this case we may use (scipy.sparse) sparse matrices instead of (numpy) arrays so as to make the data fit in memory.\n",

    "* **Supervised learning**: input data (training dataset) has a known label or result. Example problems are classification and regression. A model is prepared through a training process where it is required to make predictions and is corrected when those predictions are wrong. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.\n",
    "* **Unsupervised learning**: input data is not labeled. A model is prepared by deducing structures present in the input data. This may be to extract general rules. Example problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction and association rule learning.\n",
    "* **Semi-supervised learning**:i nput data is a mixture of labeled and unlabeled examples. There is a desired prediction problem but the model must learn the structures to organize the data as well as make predictions. Example problems are classification and regression."
