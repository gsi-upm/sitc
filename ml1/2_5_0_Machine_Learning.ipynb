    "Machine learning algorithms are programs that learn a model from a dataset with the aim of making predictions or learning structures to organize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn, machine learning algorithms take as an input a *numpy* array (n_samples, n_features), where\n",
    "* **n_samples**: number of samples. Each sample  is an item to process (i.e. classify). A sample can be a document, a picture, a sound, a video, a row in database or CSV file, or whatever you can describe with a fixed set of quantitative traits.\n",
    "* **n_features**: The number of features or distinct traits that can be used to describe each item in a quantitative manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of features should be defined in advance. There is a specific type of feature sets that are high dimensional (e.g. millions of features), but most of the values are zero for a given sample. Using (numpy) arrays, all those values that are zero would also take up memory. For this reason, these feature sets are often represented with sparse matrices (scipy.sparse) instead of (numpy) arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in machine learning is **identifying the relevant features** from the input data, and the second step is **extracting the features** from the input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Machine learning algorithms](http://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/) can be classified according to learning style into:\n",
    "* **Supervised learning**: input data (training dataset) has a known label or result. Example problems are classification and regression. A model is prepared through a training process where it is required to make predictions and is corrected when those predictions are wrong. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.\n",
    "* **Unsupervised learning**: input data is not labeled. A model is prepared by deducing structures present in the input data. This may be to extract general rules. Example problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction and association rule learning.\n",
    "* **Semi-supervised learning**:i nput data is a mixture of labeled and unlabeled examples. There is a desired prediction problem but the model must learn the structures to organize the data as well as make predictions. Example problems are classification and regression."
